The BatchCorrMetabolomics package is used in 
R. Wehrens et al., Metabolomics 12, 1-12, 2016.

Changes in version 0.1.11:
  - added this NEWS file
  - using chcr from the package with the same name for tobit
    regression, which does not rely on survival and AER, has more options and
    is faster. Results are virtually the same.
  - fixed a couple of minor issues so that the package now passes R
    CMD check (mostly NAMESPACE-related)
